# Requirements
Logitech GHUB installed  

# Why releasing?
This vulnerability was used my other project: https://github.com/ekknod/EC_PRO-LAN/  
but because of that project DMA driver ( AmdRyzenMaster) got published, and i was too lazy to remove logitech vulnerability from that project  
i decided to also release it for separate repository
